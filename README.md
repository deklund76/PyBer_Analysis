# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

This project contains a mock exploratory analysis for a Python based ride-sharing company known as "Pyber". The purpose of the analysis is to examine the relationships between the types of cities serviced by Pyber, the number of rides and drivers in each city, and the fares paid for rides. The goal is to find ways to improve access and determine affordability for underserved cities.
