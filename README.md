# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

This project contains a mock exploratory analysis for a Python based ride-sharing company known as "Pyber". The purpose of the analysis is to examine the relationships between the types of cities serviced by Pyber, the number of rides and drivers in each city, and the fares paid for rides. The goal is to find ways to improve access and determine affordability for underserved cities.

## Results

As seen in figure 1, the main challenge facing Pyber is the assymetry in supply and demand between urban and rural areas. There are over 700 drivers in urban areas that didn't even get the chance to give one ride! Worse still, the lack of drivers in Rural areas means drivers are missing out on the most profitable area; the average driver in rural areas made 3 times more than the average driver in urban areas and much much more than those poor 700 drivers who didn't make a penny. Figure 2 illustrates how steady this trend is all throughout Q1 of 2019 into April 2019. None of the city types showed substantial shifts in the amount of money made from fares week to week with the possible exception of the third week of February particularily in suburban areas.

## Summary and Recommendations

To improve access and affordability for the most underserved neighborhoods in rural areas, Pyber should encourage drivers to move further out from urban areas. One way to do this would be to increase profit sharing margins for drivers in rural and suburban areas. This would help alleviate competition and congestion in urban areas, improve access and affordability for rural customers through greater competition, and increase profits for drivers. It's a win, win, win. Even so there may very well still be just too many drivers in urban areas. Pyber could consider putting a cap on the number of active drivers allowed in urban areas to improve compensation for drivers while also further encouraging drivers to serve areas with higher demand outside city centers. Finally, to take advantage of greater fare income in  the 3rd week of Februrary, Pyber could consider introducing surge pricing, particularily in suburban areas which may have higher demand at the time. All three of these policies, especially when enacted in unison should help to improve access and affordability for customers, as well as profit margins for drivers and the company by more efficiently allocating Pyber's resources.
